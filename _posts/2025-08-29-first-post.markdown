# Welcome to my blog!!

I am Diego Barros, [mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate) lover and [watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch) enthusiast. I love anime and all things Japanese, which is pretty basic for a Gen Z like me, but that's just me.

Likewise, I have been in love with technology and anything that can compute ever since my family got their first IBM PC in 200X. The first OS I tried was Windows 98 (if you care to know). After that, I rocked Windows until Vista. By then, my big brother had taught me that there was something better out there. I am talking, of course, about ✨Linux✨ (apologies to the three Plan 9 users out there )
From there, I went down the rabbit hole: Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Mint, OpenSUSE, etc.

Nowadays, I am in a love/hate relationship with [Nix OS](https://nixos.org/), [flaking](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes) my way to perfection but suffering whenever the use case does not accommodate glorious reproducibility 🥲. Do you know that part of you that tickles whenever you notice an insignificant scratch in that new shiny thing you just bought? Yes, that is how I feel about Nix/Nix OS; it is almost perfect, and I am almost happy, so today I go to other distributions to fulfill my use cases: Ubuntu for work, RHEL (Rocky) for VPS, OpenBSD for proxies, etc.

OK, I went off on a tangent; sorry for that, I really am new at this whole blog thing.

So, yeah, I am a romantic about operating systems, and I take this whole technology thing seriously. I care about the small things, but I also want to be employable, which is what brought me to reluctantly start looking at LLMs and all the shiny new things that ✨AI ®✨ brings to the table.

What have I learned? LLMs are awesome, but they’re not magic. They’re not going to take our jobs, nor are they going to save the world.

LLMs are nothing but complicated machines, just like watches, and I think that using them correctly can greatly boost anyone's abilities. Perhaps I am overly optimistic, but I think that they could be a good thing. I am currently in the early stages of studying them, creating MCPs and self-hosting small models, power-user-level tasks.

All right, so the whole idea for this blog is to document my learnings and discoveries around all of these subjects and whatever I feel like sharing with the whole internet. I also hope to generate some engagement that could potentially lead to job opportunities and give back to the internet what it has given me—knowledge, entertainment, fun, and motivation. Plus, I want to be a human voice in a world of AI slop and hopefully slow down the death of the internet. And, of course, to practice my English writing skills (don’t worry, Spanish-speaking amigos, I’ll maintain a version of this blog in Spanish using LLMs for translation).
In summary, I am a pretty standard individual who is somewhat obsessed with a variety of things and wants to share a little about himself with the world; I will do my best to start putting things here. Hopefully, hopefully I can work out a schedule soon.
